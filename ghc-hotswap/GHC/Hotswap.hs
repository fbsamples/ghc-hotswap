{-| A library for safely interacting with frequently updating shared
objects within a haskell binary. See more documentation at <https://github.com/fbsamples/ghc-hotswap/>.

Assuming you have some structure of data called `Foo`.

In common types:
```
type FooExport = IO (StablePtr Foo)
```

In the shared object:
```
foreign export ccall "hs_mySOFunction"
  hsHandle :: FooExport

hsHandle :: FooExport
hsHandle = newStablePtr Foo
  { ...
  }
```

In the main binary:
```
main = do
  myData <- registerHotswap "hs_mySOFunction" "/path/to/lib.o"
  (withSO myData) $ \Foo{..} -> do
    -- first version
    ...

  (swapSO myData) "/path/to/next_lib.o"
  (withSO myData) $ \Foo{..} -> do
    -- next version
    ...
```

    -- normal and the old object will be unloaded when all references to it

    -- appropriately serialize these calls to avoid accidentally skipping an
    -- update.
